            draft-johansson-ccwg-rfc8298bis-screamv2-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia
   version 2 (SCReAMv2), an update to SCReAM congestion control for
   media streams such as RTP [RFC3550].  SCReAMv2 includes several
   algorithm simplifications and adds support for L4S.  The algorithm
   supports handling of multiple media streams, typical use cases are
   streaming for remote control, AR and 3D VR goggles.  This
   specification obsoletes RFC 8298.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia
   version 2 (SCReAMv2).  This specification replaces the previous
   experimental version [RFC8298] of SCReAM with SCReAMv2.  There are
   many and fairly significant changes to the original SCReAM algorithm
   as desribed in section Section 1.1.

   Both SCReAM and SCReAMv2 estimates the forward queue delay in the
   same way as Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) [RFC6817].
   However, while SCReAM is based on the self-clocking principle of TCP,
   SCReAMv2 is not entirely self-clocked as it augments self-clocking
   with pacing and a minimum send rate.

   Further, SCReAMv2 can take advantage of Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] and Low Latency Low Loss and Scalable
   throughput (L4S) [RFC9330] in cases where ECN or L4S is supported by
   the network and the hosts.  However, ECN or L4S is not required for
   the basic congestion control functionality in SCReAMv2.

1.1.  Updates Compared to SCReAM (version 1)

   The algorithm in this memo differs considerably compared to the
   previous version of SCReAM in [RFC8298].  The main differences are:

   *  L4S support added.  The L4S algoritm has many similarities with
      the DCTCP and Prague congestion control but has a few extra
      modifications to make it work well with periodic sources such as
      video.

   *  The delay based congestion control is changed to implement a
      pseudo-L4S approach, this simplifies the delay based congestion
      control.

   *  The fast increase mode is removed.  The reference window additive
      increase is replaced with an adaptive multiplicative increase to
      enhance convergence speed.

   *  The algorithm is more rate based than self-clocked:

      -  The calculated congestion window is mainly used to calculate
         proper media bitrates.  Bytes in flight is however allowed to
         exceed the reference window.  Therefore, The term reference
         window is used instead of congestion window, as the reference
         window does not set an absolute limit on the bytes in flight.

      -  The self-clocking now acts more like an emergency break as
         bytes in flight can exceed the reference window only to a
         certain degree.  The rationale is to be able to transmit large
         video frames and avoid that they are unnecessarily queued up on
         the sender side, but still prevent a large network queue.

   *  The media bitrate calculation is dramatically changed and
      simplified.  In practice it is manifested with a relatively simple
      relation between the reference window and RTT.

   *  Additional compensation is added to make SCReAMv2 handle cases
      such as large changing frame sizes.

   Algorithm changes in draft version -02 were:

   *  Slow down reference window growth when close to the last known
      maximum value is disabled and when L4S is active.  This makes
      SCReAM adhere more closely to two marked packets per RTT at steady
      state.

   *  Reference window decrease and increase reduced by up to 50% when
      ref_wnd/mss is small.  This reduces rate oscillations.

   *  Target bitrate down adjustment when ref_wnd/mss is small is
      modified to avoid that the data unit queue grows excessively in
      certain low bitrate cases.

   *  Timing set to multiples of RTTs instead of seconds.

   Draft version -03 is a major editorial pass including removal of some
   outdated or background information and reorganisation of several
   sections:

   *  Much shorter abstract and introduction focusing on what's new in
      SCReAMv2.

   *  Removal of Section 1.1. on "Wireless (LTE and 5G) Access
      Properties" and Section 1.2. on "Why is it a self-clocked
      algorithm?"

   *  New Section on "Updates compared to SCReAM (version 1)" in
      introduction based on old Section on "Algorithm Changes".

   *  Section Section 1.3 updated and shortened.

   *  Overview Section Section 3 revised; now also including the
      overview figure and the basic algorithms.

   *  Old section on "Constants and variables" removed; instead all
      variables are now listed in the respective sections that explain
      the code.

   *  New Section on "Sender Side State" explaining some basic
      variables.

   *  Pseudo code and the corresponding explanations in
      Section Section 4.2 on "Network Congestion Control" moved into the
      respective subsections in section Section 4.2.1 on "Congestion
      Detection".

   *  Separate section on "Sender Transmission Control" introduced.

   *  Section "Lost Data Unit Detection" merged into
      Section Section 4.2.1.1.

   *  Section "Stream Prioritization" removed.

   *  Section on "Competing Flows Compensation" moved into
      Section Section 4.2.1 on "Congestion Detection".

   Draft version -04

   *  Restructuring of code.

   *  Reduction of target rate when bytes_in_flight is higher than
      ref_wnd is done also when l4s_active, replaced with requirement
      that queue_delay is large.

   *  Additional constraint for increase of ref_wnd added.

   *  Discussion on when it is beneficial to reduce REF_WND_OVERHEAD
      added.

   Draft version -05 contains some clarifications based on a review by
   Per Kjellander and Björn Terelius plus some code modifications and
   text.

   *  l4s_active state removed as delay based congestion control is
      always active.

   *  ref_wnd reduction when long time since congested limited to only
      limit ref_wnd to last max_bytes_in_flight_prev.

   *  Calculation of l4s_alpha is modified to use a fast attack slow
      decay EWMA filter.

   *  Congestion backoff downscaling also for virtual L4S marking when
      ref_wnd is very small.

   *  Congestion backoff is reduced if RTT is higher than VIRTUAL_RTT.

   *  ref_wnd increase is reduced if L4S is likely non-active and queue
      delay increases.

   Draft version -06

   *  Correction of typos.

   *  Correction of send_wnd calculation.

   *  Additional variable qdelay_dev_norm that indicated how much the
      queue delay varies.

   *  Additional ref_wnd_overhead varable to limit how much bytes in
      flight can exceed the reference window in congested situations.

   *  REF_WND_OVERHEAD replaced by REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MIN and
      REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MAX.

   *  Reference window increase is restricted additionally when queue
      delay varies a lot.

   *  rel_framesize_high calculation is removed.

   *  Reduction of target bitrate when bytes in flight is high is
      removed because it is not helpful when media coders are sluggish.

   *  Calculation of l4s_alpha_v_t simplified, l4s_alpha_lim_t removed.

   *  Bug in condition for calculation of l4s_alpha_v_t fixed.

1.2.  Requirements on the Media and Feedback Protocol

   SCReAM was originally designed to with with RTP + RTCP where
   [RFC8888] was used as recommended feedback.  RTP offers unique packet
   indication with the sequence number and [RFC8888] offers timestamps
   of received packets and the status of the ECN bits.

   SCReAM is however not limited to RTP as long as some requirements are
   fulfilled :

   *  Media data is split in data units that when encapsulated in IP
      packets fit in the network MTU.

   *  Each data unit can be uniquely identified.

   *  Data units can be queued up in a packet queue before transmission.

   *  Feedback can indicate reception time for each data units, or a
      group of data units.

   *  Feedback can indicate packets that are ECN-CE marked.  Unique ECN
      bits indication for each packet is not necessary.  An ECN-CE
      counter similar to what is defined in [RFC9000] is sufficient.

1.3.  Comparison with LEDBAT and TFWC in TCP

   The core SCReAM algorithm, which is still similar in SCReAMv2, has
   similarities to the concepts of self-clocking used in TCP-friendly
   window-based congestion control [TFWC] and follows the packet
   conservation principle.  The packet conservation principle is
   described as a key factor behind the protection of networks from
   congestion [Packet-conservation].

   The reference window decrease is determined in a way similar to
   LEDBAT [RFC6817].  However, the window increase is not based on delay
   estimates but uses both a linear increase and multiplicative increase
   function depending on the time since the last congestion event and
   introduces use of inflection points in the reference window increase
   calculation to achieve reduced delay jitter.  Further, other than
   LEDBAT which is a scavenger congestion control mostly designed for
   low priority background traffic, SCReAM adjusts the qdelay target to
   compete with other loss-based congestion-controlled flows.

   SCReAMv2 adds a new reference window validation technique, as the
   reference window is used as a basis for the target bitrate
   calculation.  For that reason, various actions are taken to avoid
   that the reference window grows too much beyond the bytes in flight.
   Additional contraints are applied when in congested state and when
   the maximum target bitrate is reached.

   The SCReAM/SCReAMv2 congestion control method uses techniques similar
   to LEDBAT [RFC6817] to measure the qdelay.  As is the case with
   LEDBAT, it is not necessary to use synchronized clocks in the sender
   and receiver in order to compute the qdelay.  However, it is
   necessary that they use the same clock frequency, or that the clock
   frequency at the receiver can be inferred reliably by the sender.
   Failure to meet this requirement leads to malfunction in the SCReAM/
   SCReAMv2 congestion control algorithm due to incorrect estimation of
   the network queue delay.  Use of [RFC8888] as feedback ensures that
   the same time base is used in sender and receiver.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview of SCReAMv2 Algorithm

   SCReAMv2 consists of three main parts: network congestion control,
   sender transmission control, and media rate control.  All of these
   parts reside at the sender side while the receiver is assumpted to
   provide acknowledgements of received data units and indication of
   ECN-CE marking, either as an accumulated bytes counter, or per
   individual data unit.

   The sender implements media rate control and an data unit queue for
   each media type or source, where data units containing encoded media
   frames are temporarily stored for transmission.  Figure 1 shows the
   details when a single media source (or stream) is used.  Scheduling
   and prioritization of mulitiple streams is not covered in this
   document.  However, if multiple flows are sent, each data unit queue
   can be served based on some defined priority or simply in a round-
   robin fashion.  Alternatively, a similar approach as coupled
   congestion control [RFC6365] can be applied.

                      Figure 1: Sender Functional View

   Media frames are encoded and forwarded to the data unit queue in
   Figure 1.  The data units are sent by the sender transmission
   controller from the data unit queue.

   The sender transmission controller (in case of multiple flows a
   transmission scheduler) sends the data units to the UDP socket.  The
   sender transmission controller limits the sending rate so that the
   number of bytes in flight is less than the reference window albeit
   with a slack to avoid that packets are unnecessarily delayed in the
   data unit queue.  A pacing rate is calculated based on the target
   bitrate provided by the media rate controller.

   Feedback about the received bytes as well as metadata to estimate the
   congestion level or queuing delay are provided to the network
   congestion controller.  The network congestion controller calculates
   the reference window and provides it together with the bytes in
   flight to the sender transmission control.

   The reference window and the estimated RTT is further provided to the
   media rate control to compute the appropriate target bitrate.  The
   target bitrate is updated whenever the reference window is updated.
   Additional parameters are also communicated to make the rate control
   more stable when the congestion window is very small or when L4S is
   not active.

3.1.  Network Congestion Control

   The network congestion control sets reference window (ref_wnd) which
   puts an upper limit on how many bytes can be in flight, i.e.,
   transmitted but not yet acknowledged.  The reference window is
   however not an absolute limit as slack is given to efficiently
   transmit temporary larger media objects, such as video frames.  This
   means that the algorithm prefers to build up a queue in the network
   rather than on the sender side.  Additional congestion that this
   causes will reflect back and cause a reduction of the reference
   window.

   The reference window is reduced if congestion is detected.  Similar
   to LEDBAT, the reference window is reduced either by a fixed fraction
   in case of packet loss or Classic ECN marking, or if the estimated
   queue delay exceeds a given threshold, depending on how much the
   delay exceeds the threshold.  SCReAMv2 reduces the reference window
   in proportion to the fraction of marked packets if L4S is used
   (scalable congestion control).  The flow chart below is a simplified
   view how the reference window is updated.

              Figure 2: Network congestion control flow chart

   After a congestion event the reference window seeks to increase by
   one segment per RTT until a certain number of RTT elapses.  After
   this initial congestion avoidance phase the reference window
   increases multiplicatively where the increase factor is adjusted
   relative to a previous max value and the time elapsed since last
   congestion event.  This enables a faster convergence to a higher link
   speed.

3.2.  Sender Transmission Control

   The sender transmission control limits sending rate based on the
   relation of the estimated link throughput (bytes in flight) and the
   reference window.

   send_wnd = ref_wnd * ref_wnd_overhead - bytes_in_flight

   The respective sending rate is achieved by applying packet pacing:
   Even if the send window allows for the transmission of a number of
   packets, these packets are not transmitted immediately; rather, they
   are transmitted in intervals given by the packet size and the
   estimated link throughput.  Packets are generally paced at a higher
   rate than the target bitrate, this makes it possible to transmit
   occasionally larger video frames in a timely manner.  Further, this
   mitigates issues with ACK compression that can cause increased jitter
   and/or packet loss in the media traffic.

3.3.  Media Rate Control

   The media rate control calculates the media rate based on the
   reference window and RTT.

   target_bitrate = 8 * ref_wnd / s_rtt

   The media rate needs to ramp up quickly enough to get a fair share of
   the system resources when link throughput increases.  Further, the
   reaction to reduced throughput must be prompt in order to avoid
   getting too much data queued in the data unit queue(s) in the sender.

   For the case that multiple streams are enabled, the media rate among
   the streams is distributed according to relative priorities.

   In cases where the sender's frame queues increase rapidly, such as in
   the case of a Radio Access Type (RAT) handover, the SCReAMv2 sender
   MAY implement additional actions, such as discarding of encoded media
   frames or frame skipping in order to ensure that the data unit queues
   are drained quickly.  Frame skipping results in the frame rate being
   temporarily reduced.  Which method to use is a design choice and is
   outside the scope of this algorithm description.

4.  Detailed Description of SCReAMv2 Sender Algorithm

   This section describes the sender-side algorithm in more detail.  It
   is split between the network congestion control, sender transmission
   control, and media rate control.

4.1.  Sender Side State

   The sender needs to maintain sending state and state about the
   received feedback, as explained in the following subsections.

4.1.1.  Status Update When Sending Data

   SCReAMv2 is a window-based and byte-oriented congestion control
   protocol, where the number of bytes transmitted is inferred from the
   size of the transmitted data units.  Thus, a list of transmitted data
   units and their respective transmission times (wall-clock time) MUST
   be kept for further calculation.  Further the following variables are
   needed:

   *  data_unit_size (0): Size [byte] of the last transmitted data unit.

   *  bytes_in_flight: The number of bytes in flight is computed as the
      sum of the sizes of the data units ranging from the data unit most
      recently transmitted, down to but not including the acknowledged
      data unit with the highest sequence number.

   bytes_in_flight can be also seen as the difference between the
   highest transmitted byte sequence number and the highest acknowledged
   byte sequence number.  As an example: If a data unit with sequence
   number SN is transmitted and the last acknowledgement indicates SN-5
   as the highest received sequence number, then bytes_in_flight is
   computed as the sum of the size of data units with sequence number
   SN-4, SN-3, SN-2, SN-1, and SN.  It does not matter if, for instance,
   the data unit with sequence number SN-3 was lost -- the size of data
   unit with sequence number SN-3 will still be considered in the
   computation of bytes_in_flight.

   *  bytes_in_flight_ratio (0.0): Ratio between the bytes_in_flight and
      the reference window ref_wnd.  This value should be computed at
      the beginning of the ACK processing prior to updating the highest
      received sequence number acked.

   *  ref_wnd_ratio (0.0): Ratio between MSS and ref_wnd capped to not
      exceed 1.0 (min(1.0, MSS / ref_wnd)).

   *  max_bytes_in_flight (0): The maximum number of bytes in flight in
      the current round trip [byte].

   *  max_bytes_in_flight_prev (0): The maximum number of bytes in
      flight in previous round trip [byte].

   As bytes_in_flight can spike when congestion occurs, using the
   maximum of max_bytes_in_flight and max_bytes_in_flight_prev makes it
   more likely that an uncongested bytes_in_flight is used.

4.1.2.  Status Update on Receiving Feedback

   The feedback from the receiver is assumed to consist of the following
   elements:

   *  The wall-clock timestamp corresponding to the received data unit
      with the highest sequence number.

   *  data_units_acked: A list of received data units' sequence numbers.

   *  data_units_acked_ce: An indication if data units are ECN-CE
      marked.  The ECN status can be either per data unit or an
      accumulated count of ECN-CE marked data units.

   *  bytes_newly_acked (0): Number of bytes newly ACKed, reset to 0
      when congestion window is updated [byte].

   *  bytes_newly_acked_ce (0): Number of bytes newly ACKed and CE
      marked, reset to 0 when reference window is updated [byte].

   bytes_newly_acked is incremented with a value corresponding to how
   much the highest sequence number has increased since the last
   feedback.  As an example: If the previous acknowledgement indicated
   the highest sequence number N and the new acknowledgement indicated
   N+3, then bytes_newly_acked is incremented by a value equal to the
   sum of the sizes of data units with sequence number N+1, N+2, and
   N+3.  Data units that are lost are also included, which means that
   even though, e.g., data unit N+2 was lost, its size is still included
   in the update of bytes_newly_acked.  The bytes_newly_acked_ce is,
   similar to bytes_newly_acked, a counter of bytes newly acked with the
   extra condition that they are ECN-CE marked.  The bytes_newly_acked
   and bytes_newly_acked_ce are reset to zero after a ref_wnd update.

4.2.  Network Congestion Control

   This section explains the network congestion control, which
   calculates the reference window.  The reference window gives an upper
   limit to the number of bytes in flight.

4.2.1.  Congestion Detection: Delay, Data Unit Loss and ECN-CE

   Congestion is detected based on three different indicators:

   *  Lost data units detected,

   *  ECN-CE marked data units detected either for classic ECN or L4S,

   *  Estimated queue delay exceeds a threshold.

   A congestion event occurs if any of the above indicators are true AND
   it is at least min(VIRTUAL_RTT,s_rtt) since the last congestion
   event.  This ensures that the reference window is reduced at most
   once per smoothed RTT.

4.2.1.1.  Detecting Lost Data Units

   The reference window back-off due to loss events is deliberately a
   bit less than is the case with TCP Reno, for example.  TCP is
   generally used to transmit whole files; the file is then like a
   source with an infinite bitrate until the whole file has been
   transmitted.  SCReAMv2, on the other hand, has a source which rate is
   limited to a value close to the available transmit rate and often
   below that value; the effect is that SCReAMv2 has less opportunity to
   grab free capacity than a TCP-based file transfer.  To compensate for
   this, it is RECOMMENDED to let SCReAMv2 reduce the reference window
   less than what is the case with TCP when loss events occur.

   Lost data unit detection is based on the received sequence number
   list.  A reordering window SHOULD be applied to prevent data unit
   reordering from triggering loss events.  The reordering window is
   specified as a time unit, similar to the ideas behind Recent
   ACKnowledgement (RACK) [RFC8985].  The computation of the reordering
   window is made possible by means of a lost flag in the list of
   transmitted data units.  This flag is set if the received sequence
   number list indicates that the given data unit is missing.  If later
   feedback indicates that a previously lost marked data unit was indeed
   received, then the reordering window is updated to reflect the
   reordering delay.  The reordering window is given by the difference
   in time between the event that the data unit was marked as lost and
   the event that it was indicated as successfully received.  Loss is
   detected if a given data unit is not acknowledged within a time
   window (indicated by the reordering window) after an data unit with a
   higher sequence number was acknowledged.

4.2.1.2.  Receiving ECN-CE with classic ECN

   In classic ECN mode the ref_wnd is scaled by a fixed value
   (BETA_ECN).

   The reference window back-off due to an ECN event MAY be smaller than
   if a loss event occurs.  This is in line with the idea outlined in
   [RFC8511] to enable ECN marking thresholds lower than the
   corresponding data unit drop thresholds.

4.2.1.3.  Receiving ECN-CE for L4S

   The ref_wnd is scaled down in proportion to the fraction of marked
   data units per RTT.  The scale down proportion is given by l4s_alpha,
   which is an EWMA filtered version of the fraction of marked data
   units per RTT.  This is inline with how DCTCP works [RFC8257].
   Additional methods are applied to make the reference window reduction
   reasonably stable, especially when the reference window is only a few
   MSS.  In addition, because SCReAMv2 can quite often be source
   limited, additional steps are taken to restore the reference window
   to a proper value after a long period without congestion.

   l4s_alpha is calculated based in number of data units delivered (and
   marked) the following way:

data_units_delivered_this_rtt += data_units_acked
data_units_marked_this_rtt += data_units_acked_ce
# l4s_alpha is updated at least every 10ms
if (now - last_update_l4s_alpha_time >= min(0.01,s_rtt)
  # l4s_alpha is calculated from data_units marked istf bytes marked
  fraction_marked_t = data_units_marked_this_rtt/
                      data_units_delivered_this_rtt

  # Apply a fast attack slow decay EWMA
  if (fraction_marked_t >= l4s_alpha)
     l4s_alpha = L4S_AVG_G_UP*fraction_marked_t + (1.0-L4S_AVG_G_UP)*l4S_alpha
  else
     l4s_alpha = (1.0-L4S_AVG_G_DOWN)*l4S_alpha

  last_update_l4s_alpha_time = now
  data_units_delivered_this_rtt = 0
  data_units_marked_this_rtt = 0
  last_fraction_marked = fraction_marked_t
end

   This makes calculation of L4S alpha more accurate at very low
   bitrates, given that the tail data unit in e.g a video frame is often
   smaller than MSS.

   The following variables are used:

   *  l4s_alpha (0.0): Average fraction of marked data units per RTT.

   *  last_update_l4s_alpha_time (0): Last time l4s_alpha was updated
      [s].

   *  data_units_delivered_this_rtt (0): Counter for delivered data
      units.

   *  data_units_marked_this_rtt (0): Counter delivered and ECN-CE
      marked data units.

   *  last_fraction_marked (0.0): fraction marked data units in last
      update

   The following constants are used

   *  L4S_AVG_G_UP (1/8): Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
      factor for l4s_alpha increase

   *  L4S_AVG_G_DOWN (1/128): Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
      (EWMA) factor for l4s_alpha decrease

   The calculation of l4s_alpha is done with an fast attack slow decay
   EWMA filter.  This can give a more stable performance when L4S
   bottlenecks have high marking thresholds.

4.2.1.4.  Detecting Increased Queue Delay

   SCReAMv2 implements a delay-based congestion control approach where
   it mimics L4S congestion marking when the averaged queue delay
   exceeds a target threshold.  This threshold is set to qdelay_target/2
   and the congestion backoff factor (l4s_alpha_v) increases linearly
   from 0 to 100% as qdelay_avg goes from qdelay_target/2 to
   qdelay_target.  The averaged qdelay (qdelay_avg) is used to avoid
   that the SCReAMv2 congestion control over-reacts to scheduling
   jitter, sudden delay spikes due to e.g. handover or link layer
   retransmissions.  Furthermore, the delay based congestion control is
   inactivated when it is reasonably certain that L4S is active, i.e.
   L4S is enabled and congested nodes apply L4S marking of data units.
   This reduces negative effects of clockdrift, that the delay based
   control can introduce, whenever possible.

   qdelay_avg is updated with a slow attack, fast decay EWMA filter as
   described below.  The variable qdelay_dev_norm indicates how much the
   queue delay varies, this is calculated normalized to QDELAY_DEV_NORM.
   ~~~ if (now - last_update_qdelay_avg_time >= min(virtual_rtt,s_rtt)
   if (qdelay < qdelay_avg) qdelay_avg = qdelay else qdelay_avg =
   QDELAY_AVG_G_qdelay + (1.0-QDELAY_AVG_G)_qdelay_avg end
   qdelay_dev_norm = QDELAY_DEV_AVG_G_(qdelay -
   qdelay_avg)/QDELAY_DEV_NORM + (1.0-QDELAY_DEV_AVG_G)_qdelay_dev_norm
   last_update_qdelay_avg_time = now end ~~~

   The following variables are used:

   *  qdelay (0): When the sender receives feedback, the qdelay is
      calculated as outlined in [RFC6817].  A qdelay sample is obtained
      for each received acknowledgement.  It is typically sufficient
      with one update per received acknowledgement.

   *  last_update_qdelay_avg_time (0): Last time qdelay_avg was updated
      [s].

   *  s_rtt (0.0): Smoothed RTT [s], computed with a similar method to
      that described in [RFC6298].

   The following constant is used:

   *  QDELAY_AVG_G (1/4): Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)
      factor for qdelay_avg

   *  QDELAY_DEV_NORM (0.025): The normalization factor for
      qdelay_dev_norm

   *  QDELAY_DEV_AVG_G (1/64): Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
      (EWMA) factor for qdelay_dev_norm

4.2.1.4.1.  Competing Flows Compensation

   It is likely that a flow will have to share congested bottlenecks
   with other flows that use a more aggressive congestion control
   algorithm (for example, large FTP flows using loss-based congestion
   control).  The worst condition occurs when the bottleneck queues are
   of tail-drop type with a large buffer size.  SCReAMv2 takes care of
   such situations by adjusting the qdelay_target when loss-based flows
   are detected, as shown in the pseudocode below.

   adjust_qdelay_target(qdelay)
     qdelay_norm_t = qdelay / QDELAY_TARGET_LOW
     update_qdelay_norm_history(qdelay_norm_t)
     # Compute variance
     qdelay_norm_var_t = VARIANCE(qdelay_norm_history(200))
     # Compensation for competing traffic
     # Compute average
     qdelay_norm_avg_t = AVERAGE(qdelay_norm_history(50))
     # Compute upper limit to target delay
     new_target_t = qdelay_norm_avg_t + sqrt(qdelay_norm_var_t)
     new_target_t *= QDELAY_TARGET_LO
     if (loss_event_rate > 0.002)
       # Data unit losses detected
       qdelay_target = 1.5 * new_target_t
     else
       if (qdelay_norm_var_t < 0.2)
         # Reasonably safe to set target qdelay
         qdelay_target = new_target_t
       else
         # Check if target delay can be reduced; this helps prevent
         # the target delay from being locked to high values forever
         if (new_target_t < QDELAY_TARGET_LO)
           # Decrease target delay quickly, as measured queuing
           # delay is lower than target
           qdelay_target = max(qdelay_target * 0.5, new_target_t)
         else
           # Decrease target delay slowly
           qdelay_target *= 0.9
         end
       end
     end

     # Apply limits
     qdelay_target = min(QDELAY_TARGET_HI, qdelay_target)
     qdelay_target = max(QDELAY_TARGET_LO, qdelay_target)

   The follwoing variable is used:

   *  loss_event_rate (0.0): The estimated fraction of RTTs with lost
      data units detected.

   Two temporary variables are calculated. qdelay_norm_avg_t is the
   long-term average queue delay, qdelay_norm_var_t is the long-term
   variance of the queue delay.  A high qdelay_norm_var_t indicates that
   the queue delay changes; this can be an indication that bottleneck
   bandwidth is reduced or that a competing flow has just entered.
   Thus, it indicates that it is not safe to adjust the queue delay
   target.

   A low qdelay_norm_var_t indicates that the queue delay is relatively
   stable.  The reason could be that the queue delay is low, but it
   could also be that a competing flow is causing the bottleneck to
   reach the point that data unit losses start to occur, in which case
   the queue delay will stay relatively high for a longer time.

   The queue delay target is allowed to be increased if either the loss
   event rate is above a given threshold or qdelay_norm_var_t is low.
   Both these conditions indicate that a competing flow may be present.
   In all other cases, the queue delay target is decreased.

   The function that adjusts the qdelay_target is simple and could
   produce false positives and false negatives.  The case that self-
   inflicted congestion by the SCReAMv2 algorithm may be falsely
   interpreted as the presence of competing loss-based FTP flows is a
   false positive.  The opposite case -- where the algorithm fails to
   detect the presence of a competing FTP flow -- is a false negative.

   Extensive simulations have shown that the algorithm performs well in
   LTE and 5G test cases and that it also performs well in simple
   bandwidth-limited bottleneck test cases with competing FTP flows.
   However, the potential failure of the algorithm cannot be completely
   ruled out.  A false positive (i.e., when self-inflicted congestion is
   mistakenly identified as competing flows) is especially problematic
   when it leads to increasing the target queue delay, which can cause
   the end-to-end delay to increase dramatically.

   If it is deemed unlikely that competing flows occur over the same
   bottleneck, the algorithm described in this section MAY be turned
   off.  One such case is QoS-enabled bearers in 3GPP-based access such
   as LTE and 5G.  However, when sending over the Internet, often the
   network conditions are not known for sure, so in general it is not
   possible to make safe assumptions on how a network is used and
   whether or not competing flows share the same bottleneck.  Therefore,
   turning this algorithm off must be considered with caution, as it can
   lead to basically zero throughput if competing with loss-based
   traffic.

4.2.2.  Reference Window Update

   The reference window update contains two parts.  One that reduces the
   reference window when congestion events (listed above) occur, and one
   part that continuously increases the reference window.

   The following variables are defined:

   *  ref_wnd (MIN_REF_WND): Reference window [byte].

   *  ref_wnd_i (1): Reference window inflection point [byte].

   *  qdelay_target (QDELAY_TARGET_LO): qdelay target [s], a variable
      qdelay target is introduced to manage cases where a fixed qdelay
      target would otherwise starve the data flow under such
      circumstances (e.g., FTP competes for the bandwidth over the same
      bottleneck).  The qdelay target is allowed to vary between
      QDELAY_TARGET_LO and QDELAY_TARGET_HI.

   *  last_congestion_detected_time (0): Last time congestion detected
      [s].

   *  last_reaction_to_congestion_time (0): Last time congestion
      avoidance occured [s].

   *  last_ref_wnd_i_update_time (0): Last time ref_wnd_i was updated
      [s].

   Further the following constants are used (the RECOMMENDED values,
   within parentheses "()", for the constants are deduced from
   experiments):

   *  QDELAY_TARGET_LO (0.06): Target value for the minimum qdelay [s].

   *  QDELAY_TARGET_HI (0.4): Target value for the maximum qdelay [s].
      This parameter provides an upper limit to how much the target
      qdelay (qdelay_target) can be increased in order to cope with
      competing loss-based flows.  However, the target qdelay does not
      have to be initialized to this high value, as it would increase
      end-to-end delay and also make the rate control and congestion
      control loops sluggish.

   *  MIN_REF_WND (3000): Minimum reference window [byte].

   *  BYTES_IN_FLIGHT_HEAD_ROOM (1.5): Extra headroom for bytes in
      flight.

   *  BETA_LOSS (0.7): ref_wnd scale factor due to loss event.

   *  BETA_ECN (0.8): ref_wnd scale factor due to ECN event.

   *  MSS (1000): Maximum segment size = Max data unit size [byte].

   *  POST_CONGESTION_DELAY_RTT (100): Determines how many RTTs after a
      congestion event the reference window growth should be cautious.

   *  MUL_INCREASE_FACTOR (0.02): Determines how much (as a fraction of
      ref_wnd) that the ref_wnd can increase per RTT.

   *  IS_L4S (false): Congestion control operates in L4S mode.

   *  VIRTUAL_RTT (0.025): Virtual RTT [s].  This mimics Prague's RTT
      fairness such that flows with RTT below VIRTUAL_RTT should get a
      roughly equal share over an L4S path.

end

# Scale up increment with multiplicative increase
# Limit multiplicative increase when congestion occurred

float tmp_t = ref_wnd_scale_factor_t
if (tmp_t > 1.0)
  tmp_t = 1.0 + (tmp_t - 1.0) * post_congestion_scale_t * scl_t;
end
increment_t *= tmp_t

# Increase ref_wnd only if bytes in flight is large enough
# Quite a lot of slack is allowed here to avoid that bitrate
# locks to low values.
# Increase is inhibited if max target bitrate is reached.
max_allowed_t = MSS + max(max_bytes_in_flight,
  max_bytes_in_flight_prev) * BYTES_IN_FLIGHT_HEAD_ROOM
int ref_wnd_t = ref_wnd + increment_t
if (ref_wnd_t <= max_allowed_t && target_bitrate < TARGET_BITRATE_MAX)
  ref_wnd = ref_wnd_t
end

   The ref_wnd_scale_factor_t scales the reference window increase.  The
   ref_wnd_scale_factor_t is increased with larger ref_wnd to allow for
   a multiplicative increase and thus a faster convergence when link
   capacity increases.

   The multiplicative increase is restricted directly after a congestion
   event and the restriction is gradually relaxed as the time since last
   congested increased.  The restriction makes the reference window
   growth to be no faster than additive increase when congestion
   continuously occurs.  For L4S operation this means that the SCReAMv2
   algorithm will adhere to the 2 marked data units per RTT equilibrium
   at steady state congestion, with the exception of the case below.

   The reference window increase is restricted to values as small as
   0.1MSS/RTT when the reference window is close to the last known max
   value (ref_wnd_i).  This increases stability and reduces periodic
   overshoot.  This restriction is applied in full only for small
   reference windows when in L4S operation.

   It is particularly important that the reference window reflects the
   transmitted bitrate especially in L4S mode operation.  An inflated
   ref_wnd takes extra RTTs to bring down to a correct value upon
   congestion and thus causes unnecessary queue buildup.  At the same
   time the reference window must be allowed to be large enough to avoid
   that the SCReAMv2 algorithm begins to limit itself, given that the
   target bitrate is calculated based on the ref_wnd.  Two mechanisms
   are used to manage this:

   *  Restore correct value of ref_wnd upon congestion.  This is done if
      is a prolonged time since the link was congested.  A typical
      example is that SCReAMv2 has been rate limited, i.e the target
      bitrate has reached the TARGET_BITRATE_MAX.

   *  Limit ref_wnd when the target_bitrate has reached
      TARGET_BITRATE_MAX.  The ref_wnd is restricted based on a history
      of the last max_bytes_in_flight values.  See
      [SCReAM-CPP-implementation] for details.

   The two mechanisms complement one another.

4.3.  Sender Transmission Control

   The Sender Transmission control calculates of send window at the
   sender.  Data units are transmitted if allowed by the relation
   between the number of bytes in flight and the reference window.  This
   is controlled by the send window:

   *  send_wnd (0): Upper limit to how many bytes can currently be
      transmitted.  Updated when ref_wnd is updated and when data unit
      is transmitted [byte].

4.3.1.  Send Window Calculation

   The basic design principle behind data unit transmission in SCReAM
   was to allow transmission only if the number of bytes in flight is
   less than the congestion window.  There are, however, two reasons why
   this strict rule will not work optimally:

   *  Bitrate variations: Media sources such as video encoders generally
      produce frames whose size always vary to a larger or smaller
      extent.  The data unit queue absorbs the natural variations in
      frame sizes.  However, the data unit queue should be as short as
      possible to prevent the end-to-end delay from increasing.  A
      strict 'send only when bytes in flight is less than the reference
      window' rule can cause the data unit queue to grow simply because
      the send window is limited.  The consequence is that the reference
      window will not increase, or will increase very slowly, because
      the reference window is only allowed to increase when there is a
      sufficient amount of data in flight.  The final effect is that the
      media bitrate increases very slowly or not at all.

   *  Reverse (feedback) path congestion: Especially in transport over
      buffer-bloated networks, the one-way delay in the reverse
      direction can jump due to congestion.  The effect is that the
      acknowledgements are delayed, and the self-clocking is temporarily
      halted, even though the forward path is not congested.  The
      ref_wnd_overhead allows for some degree of reverse path congestion
      as the bytes in flight is allowed to exceed ref_wnd.

   In SCReAMv2, the send window is given by the relation between the
   adjusted reference window and the amount of bytes in flight according
   to the pseudocode below.  The multiplication of ref_wnd with
   ref_wnd_overhead has the effect that bytes in flight is 'around' the
   ref_wnd rather than limited by the ref_wnd.  The implementation
   allows the data unit queue to be small even when the frame sizes vary
   and thus increased e2e delay can be avoided.

   send_wnd = ref_wnd * ref_wnd_overhead - bytes_in_flight

   The send window is updated whenever an data unit is transmitted or an
   feedback messaged is received.

   The ref_wnd_overhead is adjusted dynamically.  A large overhead is
   beneficial when the network link is uncongested as it allows to
   transmit large media frames with little transmission delay.  A large
   overhead is also beneficial for cases where network links use virtual
   queue marking or can temporarly absorb bursts from L4S capable flows.
   If, on the other hand the network link is congested, then it is
   better to restrict how much bytes in flight exceeds the reference
   window because is not possible to push data faster than the reference
   window allows.  This restriction reduces varaitions in RTT caused by
   self-congestion and improves performance for the cases where media
   encoders are slow to react to changes in target rate.

   The following constants are used (the RECOMMENDED values, within
   parentheses "()", for the constants are deduced from experiments):

   *  REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MIN (1.5): Indicates a lower limit how much bytes
      in flight is allowed to exceed ref_wnd.

   *  REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MAX (4.0): Indicates an upper limit how much
      bytes in flight is allowed to exceed ref_wnd.  This is roughly
      equal to MAX_RELAXED_PACING_FACTOR to allow that media frames can
      be transmitted quickly when the transmission channel is
      uncongested.

   The ref_wnd_overhead is calculated as:

ref_wnd_overhead = REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MIN +
  (REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MAX + REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MIN)*max(0.0,(0.1-qdelay_dev_norm)/0.1)

4.3.2.  Packet Pacing

   Packet pacing is used in order to mitigate coalescing, i.e., when
   packets are transmitted in bursts, with the risks of increased jitter
   and potentially increased packet loss.  Packet pacing is also
   recommended to be used with L4S and also mitigates possible issues
   with queue overflow due to key-frame generation in video coders.
   However, when the link is congested it is beneficial to relax the
   packet pacing and allow frames to be transmitted faster.

   *  pace_bitrate (1e6): Data unit pacing rate [bps].

   *  t_pace (1e-6): Pacing interval between data units [s].

   The following constants are used by the packet pacing:

   *  RATE_PACE_MIN (50000): Minimum pacing rate in [bps].

   *  PACKET_PACING_HEADROOM (1.5): Extra head room for packet pacing.

   *  MAX_RELAXED_PACING_FACTOR (4.0): Max extra packet pacing when the
      media coder reaches the max bitrate.  This should be roughly equal
      to REF_WND_OVERHEAD_MAX.

   *  RELAXED_PACING_LIMIT_LOW (0.8): Nominal bitrate fraction of
      TARGET_BITRATE_MAX at which the pacing should be increasingly
      relaxed.

   The time interval between consecutive data unit transmissions is
   greater than or equal to t_pace, where t_pace is given by the
   equations below:

pace_bitrate = max(RATE_PACE_MIN, target_bitrate) *
               PACKET_PACING_HEADROOM

# Calculate and apply relaxed pacing
nominal_rate_t = target_bitrate/TARGET_BITRATE_MAX
pace_rate_scale_t = min(1.0,
  (nominal_rate_t-RELAXED_PACING_LIMIT_LOW)/(1.0 - RELAXED_PACING_LIMIT_LOW))
pace_rate_scale_t = min(1.0,
  max(1.0 / MAX_RELAXED_PACING_FACTOR, 1.0 - pace_rate_scale_t))
pace_bitrate /= pace_rate_scale_t

t_pace = data_unit_size * 8 / pace_bitrate

   data_unit_size is the size of the last transmitted data unit.
   RATE_PACE_MIN is the minimum pacing rate.

4.4.  Media Rate Control

   The media rate control algorithm is executed whenever the reference
   window is updated and calculates the target bitrate:

   *  target_bitrate (0): Media target bitrate [bps].

   The following constants are used by the media rate control:

   *  BYTES_IN_FLIGHT_LIMIT (0.9)

   *  BYTES_IN_FLIGHT_LIMIT_COMPENSATION (1.5)

   *  PACKET_OVERHEAD (20) : Estimated packetization overhead [byte]

   *  TARGET_BITRATE_MIN: Minimum target bitrate in [bps] (bits per
      second).

   *  TARGET_BITRATE_MAX: Maximum target bitrate in [bps].

   The target bitrate is essentiatlly based on the reference window
   ref_wnd and the (smoothed) RTT s_rtt according to

   target_bitrate = 8 * ref_wnd / s_rtt

   The role of the media rate control is to strike a reasonable balance
   between a low amount of queuing in the data unit queue(s) and a
   sufficient amount of data to send in order to keep the data path
   busy.  Because the reference window is updated based on loss, ECN-CE
   and delay, so does the target rate also update.

   The code above however needs some modifications to work fine in a
   number of scenarios

   *  L4S is inactive, i.e L4S is either not enabled or congested
      bottlenecks do not L4S mark data units

   *  ref_wnd is very small, just a few MSS or smaller

   The complete pseudo code for adjustment of the target bitrate is
   shown below

   tmp_t = 1.0

   # Scale down rate slightly when the reference window is very
   # small compared to MSS
   tmp_t *= 1.0 - min(0.2, max(0.0, ref_wnd_ratio - 0.1))

   # Additional compensation for packetization overhead,
   # important when MSS is small
   tmp_t_ *= mss/(mss + PACKET_OVERHEAD)

   # An additional downscaling is needed to avoid unnecessary
   # sender queue build-up, better to set the target bitrate
   # slightly lower than what ref_wnd and s_rtt
   tmp_t /= 1.1

   # Calculate target bitrate and limit to min and max allowed
   # values
   target_bitrate = tmp_t * 8 * ref_wnd / s_rtt
   target_bitrate = min(TARGET_BITRATE_MAX,
     max(TARGET_BITRATE_MIN,target_bitrate))

4.4.1.  Handling of systematic errors in video coders

   Some video encoders are prone to systematically generate an output
   bitrate that is systematically larger or smaller than the target
   bitrate.  SCReAMv2 can handle some deviation inherently but for
   larger deviations it becomes necessary to compensate for this.  The
   algorithm for this is detailed in [SCReAM-CPP-implementation].

   ToDo: A future draft version will describe this in more detail as it
   has been fully integrated into SCReAMv2.

5.  Receiver Requirements on Feedback Intensity

   The simple task of the receiver is to feed back acknowledgements with
   with time stamp and ECN bits indication for received data units to
   the sender.  Upon reception of each data unit, the receiver MUST
   maintain enough information to send the aforementioned values to the
   sender via an RTCP transport- layer feedback message.  The frequency
   of the feedback message depends on the available RTCP bandwidth.  The
   requirements on the feedback elements and the feedback interval are
   described below.

   SCReAMv2 benefits from relatively frequent feedback.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that a SCReAMv2 implementation follows the guidelines
   below.

   The feedback interval depends on the media bitrate.  At low bitrates,
   it is sufficient with a feedback every frame; while at high bitrates,
   a feedback interval of roughly 5ms is preferred.  At very high
   bitrates, even shorter feedback intervals MAY be needed in order to
   keep the self-clocking in SCReAMv2 working well.  One indication that
   feedback is too sparse is that the SCReAMv2 implementation cannot
   reach high bitrates, even in uncongested links.  More frequent
   feedback might solve this issue.

   The numbers above can be formulated as a feedback interval function
   that can be useful for the computation of the desired RTCP bandwidth.
   The following equation expresses the feedback rate:

   # Assume 100 byte feedback packets
   rate_fb = 0.02 * [average received rate] / (100.0 * 8.0);
   rate_fb = min(1000, max(10, rate_fb))

   # Calculate feedback intervals
   fb_int = 1.0/rate_fb

   Feedback should also forcibly be transmitted in any of these cases:

   *  More than N data units received since last feedback has been
      transmitted

   *  A data unit with marker bit set or other last data unit for media
      frame is received

   The transmission interval is not critical.  So, in the case of multi-
   stream handling between two hosts, the feedback for two or more
   synchronization sources (SSRCs) can be bundled to save UDP/IP
   overhead.  However, the final realized feedback interval SHOULD NOT
   exceed 2*fb_int in such cases, meaning that a scheduled feedback
   transmission event should not be delayed more than fb_int.

   SCReAMv2 works with AVPF regular mode; immediate or early mode is not
   required by SCReAMv2 but can nonetheless be useful for RTCP messages
   not directly related to SCReAMv2, such as those specified in
   [RFC4585].  It is RECOMMENDED to use reduced-size RTCP [RFC5506],
   where regular full compound RTCP transmission is controlled by trr-
   int as described in [RFC4585].

   While the guidelines above are somewhat RTCP specific, similar
   principles apply to for instance QUIC.

6.  Discussion

   This section covers a few discussion points.

   *  Clock drift and clock skipping: SCReAM/SCReAMv2 can suffer from
      the same issues with clock drift as is the case with LEDBAT
      [RFC6817].  However, Appendix A.2 in [RFC6817] describes ways to
      mitigate issues with clock drift.  A clockdrift compensation
      method is also implemented in [SCReAM-CPP-implementation].
      Furthermore, the SCReAM implementation resets base delay history
      when it is determined that clock drift or skip becomes too large.
      This is achieved by reducing the target bitrate for a few RTTs.
      More details on this will be provided in a later draft version.

   *  The target bitrate given by SCReAMv2 is the bitrate including the
      data unit and Forward Error Correction (FEC) overhead.  The media
      encoder SHOULD take this overhead into account when the media
      bitrate is set.  This means that the media coder bitrate SHOULD be
      computed as: media_rate = target_bitrate -
      data_unit_plus_fec_overhead_bitrate It is not necessary to make a
      100% perfect compensation for the overhead, as the SCReAM
      algorithm will inherently compensate for moderate errors.  Under-
      compensating for the overhead has the effect of increasing jitter,
      while overcompensating will cause the bottleneck link to become
      underutilized.

   *  The link utilization with SCReAMv2 can be lower than 100%. There
      are several possible reasons to this:

      -  Large variations in frame sizes: Large variations in frame size
         makes SCReAMv2 push down the target_bitrate to give sufficient
         headroom and avoid queue buildup in the network.  It is in
         general recommended to operate video coders in low latency mode
         and enable GDR (Gradual Decoding Refresh) if possible to
         minimize frame size variations.

      -  Link layer properties: Media transport in 5G in uplink
         typically requires to transmit a scheduling request (SR) to get
         persmission to transmit data.  Because transmission of video is
         frame based, there is a high likelihood that the channel
         becomes idle between frames (especially with L4S), in which
         case a new SR/grant exchange is needed.  This potentially means
         that uplink transmission slots are unused with a lower link
         utilization as a result.

   *  Packet pacing is recommended, it is however possible to operate
      SCReAMv2 with packet pacing disabled.  The code in
      [SCReAM-CPP-implementation] implements additional mechanisms to
      achieve a high link utilization when packet pacing is disabled.

   *  Feedback issues: RTCP feedback packets [RFC8888] can be lost, this
      means that the loss detection in SCReAMv2 may trigger even though
      packets arrive safely on the receiver side.
      [SCReAM-CPP-implementation] solves this by using overlapping RTCP
      feedback, i.e RTCP feedback is transmitted no more seldom than
      every 16th packet, and where each RTCP feedback spans the last 32
      received packets.  This however creates unnecessary overhead.
      [RFC3550] RR (Receiver Reports) can possibly be another solution
      to achieve better robustness with less overhead.  QUIC [RFC9000]
      overcomes this issue because of inherent design.

   *  SCReAM has over time been evaluated in a number of different
      experiments, a few examples are found in [SCReAM-evaluation-L4S].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   The feedback can be vulnerable to attacks similar to those that can
   affect TCP.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the RTCP feedback is at
   least integrity protected.  Furthermore, as SCReAM/SCReAMv2 is self-
   clocked, a malicious middlebox can drop RTCP feedback packets and
   thus cause the self-clocking to stall.  However, this attack is
   mitigated by the minimum send rate maintained by SCReAM/SCReAMv2 when
   no feedback is received.
